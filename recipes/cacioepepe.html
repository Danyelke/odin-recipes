        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This spaghetti cacio e pepe recipe has been made in our family for many years, and everyone loves it. 
            It is a very basic and easy variation on mac and cheese.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 ¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain spaghetti.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic and pepper in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cooked spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Stir in more cooking water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            You can substitute butter for olive oil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adjust the amount of cooking water added in step 2 for a thicker or thinner sauce. If you add too much water, add some more cheese.

            I add flavor-enhancing ingredients — like pancetta — to this recipe depending on my main dish; I always experiment when creating food.
